# Factorio Resource Objectives

https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ResourceObjectives

Adds intermediate objectives to the game to help get towards rocket launch just a bit easier. Each objective consists of a list of resources, and the player earns additional resources when completing the objectives. Designed for vanilla Factorio, but works with mods as well – especially mods that don't add a lot of new items.

This mod is in development. The objectives have been play-tested only until early oil-era.

Works in multiplayer.

`/next_objective` and `/previous_objective` are handy when upgrading the mod version in the middle of a game.

## Helping with play testing

You can export a log file with `/ro_save_analytics` – this will go to the `script-output` in your factorio folder. The log file contains the in-game timestamps for each completed objective – this is extremely helpful information for balancing the objectives. You can submit an export to [the discussion page](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ResourceObjectives/discussion/63cdc33313739ac587f9ca39), or to the google forms link below. Log files are useful even if you don't complete the game.

You can also add free-form comments to the log file with `/ro_feedback`. This will add the current in-game timestamp to your message. Especially comments like ”the next objective feels exciting / too easy / too hard” are valuable. You may also explain any milestones that you are reaching in the game outside the explicit objective, or give any sort of ideas.
